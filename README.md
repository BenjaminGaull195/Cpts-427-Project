# Cpts-427-Project
This is a continuation of the banking app project from Cpts 321 Software Development Principles.  In this project I will be adding encryption and authentication features to make the app more secure


### Notes for Milestone 1
- There is little to no code written so far for the project.
- The lines of code found in Startup.cs used to to add TLS/SSL to the project are as follows:
  - Line 48 (Restrict Access; Only allows HTTPS connection)
  - Line 51 (redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
- Because the project was generated from a template, most of the files are not relevant and will be either replaced or removed as the project progresses
